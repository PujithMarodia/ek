 <p class="mainp">Calcium is a chemical element with symbol Ca and atomic number 20. Calcium is a silvery metal (sometimes described as pale yellow). The largest use of calcium is in steelmaking, due to its strong chemical affinity for oxygen and sulfur. It is also used in maintenance-free automotive batteries and more. </p> </div>

    <h1 class="mainh3">Fun Facts!</h1>
<p class="mainp2">1. Pure calcium is actually a metal, and reacts very strongly, sometimes violently (explosively) with water and acids.</p>    
<p class="mainp2">2. Even though calcium has been known for thousands of years, it wasn't purified and identified as an element until 1808 by Sir Humphrey Davy of England.</p>
<p class="mainp2">3. Calcium isn't just used for making strong bones! It is used to make cement, cheese, removing nonmetal from different metal mixes (called alloys), and also is used as an agent in the preparation of other metals.</p>
<p class="mainp2">4. The best sources of calcium in the diet are milk, yogurt, and cheese. Nearly 72% of the calcium in the US comes from dairy foods.</p>
